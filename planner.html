        <h6 class="teal-text">Popular Buzzwords Used:</h6>
        <b><p>If you're a complete beginner you shouldn't worry about this too much. A lot of this knowledge will come with experience.</p></b>
        <ul class="collection">
          <li class="collection-item">
            <p><b>Hypertrophy</b> - This is a fancy word for gaining muscle.</p>
            <p><b>Progressive Overload</b> - Your body eventually adapts to doing the same workout over and over again. You either need to add more weight, add more reps, or add another workout day to your routine.</p>
            <p><b>Volume</b> - The total number or reps performed in a workout.</p>
            <p><b>Intensity</b> - The amount of weight lifted and how taxing it is on your body.</p>
            <p><b>Frequency</b> - How often you go to the gym.</p>
            <p><b>Periodization</b> - How your program is organized and how you progress in your lifts.</p>
            <ul class="browser-default">
              <li><b>Linear Periodization</b> - Your progression moves in a straight line. Each day or week you're either adding more weight or more reps to your workouts.</li>
              <li><b>Conjugate(Non-Linear) Periodization</b> - Your progression is up and down (kinda like a Sine Wave), but overall you're gaining strength and helping your body adapt to new loads. It involves layering strength, muscle mass and power training into one solid week of hard training, which is then repeated for a cycle length.</li>
              <li>There are many more different types but these two are the most common. If you're a complete beginner you don't need to worry about this.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>IIFYM</b> - Stands for "If It Fits Your Macros". It's a style of dieting based around your required Macronutrient needs (The amount of Carbs, Protein, and Fat you need per day).</p>
            <p><b>RPE</b> - Stands for "Rate of Perceived Exertion". It's essentially a rating system for how hard an exercise is in your workout. It's scaled from 1 to 10 (1 being very easy and you could do 10 or more reps with ease)(10 being extremely difficult and you can barely complete one rep).</p>
            <p><b>RIR</b> - Stands for "Reps in Reserve". It's the same thing as RPE, but a little more intuitive (RIR 1 means you can only perform 1 rep)(RIR 10 means you can do 10 or more reps with ease).</p>
            <p><b>Mesocycle</b> - Complete length of a program.</p>
            <p><b>Microcycle</b> - Programs are usually broken up into phases(typically each invidual week), each phase would be considered a Micorcycle (If a program is 6 weeks long, that would be considered a 6 week Mesocycle and each week is 1 Microcycle).</p>
